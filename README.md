## Bonding of Materials by Coulomb's Law

We are aiming to graphically demonstrate the union of 2 materials by means of friction, starting from Coulomb's law.

Electrostatics is one of the most present natural phenomena in nature. And the one that has had the most applications is Coulomb's law, where all the interrogations of the different charges and matter intervene, obtaining an attractive force by the friction method, which is sought to be graphically demonstrated in an animation. This method consists of joining two metals in the form of cylinders and putting them in a lathe, where one remains fixed and the other, being together, makes a circular movement at a controlled speed, which generates friction and a bonding force.

Hoping to accomplish with the project objectives, we appreciate the opportunity to participate in this year's hackathon and we wish the best of luck to everyone.
